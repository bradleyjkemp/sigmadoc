Although recently it has been used in DNSSec, the value being set to anything other than 0 should be rare. Otherwise if it is set to non 0 and DNSSec is being used, then excluding the legitimate domains is low effort and high reward. Determine if multiple of these files were accessed in a short period of time to further enhance the possibility of seeing if this was a one off or the possibility of larger sensitive file gathering.
